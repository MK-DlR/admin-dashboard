TIPS
1. when building layout
    a. apply background colors and/or borders to help visualize grid

2. can use px, fr, or both for grid tracks

3. does not have to be responsive
    a. can optionally expand/shrink the project cards
        a1. when resizing browser window

4. design doesn't have to fully match example
    a. freedom to come up with own design
